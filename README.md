================

The purpose of this script is to download the newly freely available MapPluto data, extract, merge to a File Geodatabse.
You can find them here:

But you don't need to b/c the script will download the files and extract for you (hopefully). 

Requirements (or at least what I used successfully) :
Windows 7
Python 2.7
ArcGIS 10.2
